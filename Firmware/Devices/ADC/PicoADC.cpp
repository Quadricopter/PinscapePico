// Copyright 2024, 2025 Michael J Roberts / BSD-3-Clause license / NO WARRANTY
//
// Implements the ADC Manager's abstract device interface for the Pico's
// on-board ADC.
//
// We run the native ADC in continuous mode, and we can sample one or more
// of the inputs using the device's round-robin mode.  In round-robin mode,
// the hardware automatically cycles through the enabled ports sequentially,
// emitting one sample for each enabled port, then cycling back to the first
// port.
//
// The Pico ADC has a fixed integration time of 2us when using its default
// 48MHz clock input (the actual time is 96 cycles on its clock source,
// which works out to exactly 2us with a 48MHz clock).  Unfortunately, it
// doesn't have a native averaging mode, so it's up to client software to
// implement oversampling.  We do, by continuously collecting samples into
// a ring buffer, and computing an average over the most recent segment
// of the buffer whenever a client asks to read a sample.
//
// The 2us ADC cycle is too fast to collect samples with an IRQ handler.
// We'd spend about 50% of CPU time in the IRQ handler, and we'd *still*
// miss some samples due to increased interrupt latency when other
// peripherals are firing at the same time.  The only way to keep up with
// the 2us ADC cycle is to move the samples into memory without CPU
// involvement, via DMA.  To keep DMA running continuously, we use two
// channels, which we designate A and B.  Channel A collects samples into
// the lower half of a ring buffer, and channel B collects samples into
// the upper half of the buffer.  We still need an IRQ handler, but the
// IRQ handler is for DMA completion rather than ADC completion, so it
// only fires once ever N/2 samples (where N is the buffer size in
// samples).  If we make N = 1024, this gives us 512*2us = 1ms between
// interrupts, which (a) reduces interrupt overhead to neglible levels,
// and (b) gives us an extremely long latency cushion to respond to
// interrupts, since we only have to response to the Channel A interrupt
// before Channel B finishes 1ms later, and vice versa.  This gives us
// essentially deterministic timing that ensures we never miss a single
// sample.  That's only a nice-to-have when reading a single channel,
// where a missed sample (or even a large number of missed samples) will
// have negligible impact on the averages.  But it's critical in
// round-robin mode, because the interleaving scheme means that clients
// will be reading from the wrong channel if we ever miss even a single
// sample.  That utterly randomizes the results, so it can't be allowed
// to happen, ever, even rarely.  We need perfectly deterministic timing,
// which is really only possible in this environment with the dual DMA
// scheme just described.
