// Pinscape Pico - Toshiba TCD1103 linear CCD photo sensor, 1x1500 pixels
// Copyright 2024, 2025 Michael J Roberts / BSD-3-Clause license / NO WARRANTY
//
// This implementation uses a Pico PIO state machine to generate the
// shift-register clock signal, the Pico's on-board ADC to sample the analog
// pixel signal, and DMA to transfer samples from the ADC to the frame
// buffers.
//
// The TCD1103 has a number of requirements for its logic signal timing,
// particularly for the sequence of signals that initiate a new frame.  It
// requires the host to generate a continuously running master clock signal,
// which also serves as the shift register clock to transfer pixels to the
// analog output.  See the data sheet for details.
//
//
// Implementation Notes
//
// To maximum the frame rate, we capture frames continuously.  Every time
// we finish transferring one frame, we start transferring the next.  The
// sensor is designed with this procedure in mind: it provides an internal
// shift register that serves as the source of the pixel data transfer, with
// an electronic shutter function that transfers a snapshot of the live
// sensor pixels over to the shift register at a moment of the host's
// choosing.  The host can transfer data from the shift register over a
// serial connection at its leisure.  Since the shift register contains a
// snapshot of the entire live pixel array at a moment in time, we always
// get a still snapshot (with no "tearing") regardless of the amount of time
// the transfer takes.  Meanwhile, while the serial data transfer is taking
// place, the live pixels are integrating incident photons for the *next*
// frame snapshot.
//
// To manage the continuous data transfer, we use double buffering.  We use
// DMA to transfer the incoming pixel data from the new frame into one
// buffer, while the other buffer, containing the completed transfer from
// the previous frame, is available for clients to read from.  The TCD1103
// presents the serial pixel output as an analog voltage level proportional
// to the brightness of the current pixel being clocked from the shift
// register, so we use the Pico's on-board ADC to read the incoming pixels.
// The on-board ADC is fast and is integrated with the Pico's DMA
// controller, so we can use it to perform the transfers asynchronously,
// without any CPU involvement in moving the bytes.
//
// We use three DMA channels to manage the double buffering scheme.
// Channels A and B (arbitrary labels we use for identification purposes)
// correspond to the two halves of the double buffer.  Channel C is a "link"
// between the two buffers.  We use the Pico DMA controller's CHAIN_TO
// feature to arrange the DMA channels in a circular pattern:
//
//    A -> C -> B -> C -> A ...
//
// This pattern repeats indefinitely.  Channel C serves two purposes: first,
// it's the intermediary in the CHAIN_TO links from A to B and from B to A.
// Second, it withdraws samples from the DMA FIFO in the period between two
// frames, when we must send the TCD1103 a series of signals to operate the
// electronic shutter, to make a snapshot of the live pixels in the sensor's
// shift register and start clocking them out on its serial output.  This is
// a short period of about 5us during which the sensor isn't generating any
// pixel output.  We still have to read the ADC output during this period,
// though, because we want to keep the Pico's ADC running continuously to
// minimize down time between frames.  So channel C simply reads from the
// ADC and writes to a dummy location in memory, whose only purpose is to
// sink the unused dummy samples from the ADC read between frames.
//
// The cycle A -> C -> B -> C -> A can't be programmed statically in the DMA
// channels, since C's LINK_TO has to change from A to B to A on alternating
// frames.  Even if we could program the LINK_TO chain statically, we'd
// still have to reprogram the A and B output buffers on each cycle, since
// the channel writer pointers auto-increment to the end of their respective
// buffers on each frame.  So we need to reprogram several DMA settings on
// each frame.  To handle this, we program channel C to fire a DMA0 IRQ on
// completion, and we do the necessary channel reprogramming in the
// interrupt handler.  The reprogramming work is extremely lightweight, so
// the IRQ handler only takes about 3us on each cycle.  The IRQ handler
// doesn't add to the overall cycle time, since the DMA transfer into the
// next buffer proceeds asynchronously even while the IRQ handler is
// running.  Because of this, we must keep the DMA channels programmed one
// frame ahead at all times, so that the DMA runs non-stop while we're
// programming the next frame in the IRQ.
//
// To TCD1103 requires three input signals, referred to in the data sheet as
// FM (master clock(, SH (shift gate), and ICG (integration clear gate) to
// operate the electronic shutter and serial data transfer.  The data sheet
// conceives of all three signals as periodic clocks, but that reflects a
// dated assumption about how the host is implemented, namely that the host
// uses a simple hardware clock generator for each signal.  A more modern
// view would conceive of SH and ICG as GPIO output signals from a
// microcontroller.  The data sheet incorrectly claims that SH and ICG must
// be periodic, but empirically, that makes no difference to the sensor.
// It only cares about the timing of the signal edges relative to the other
// signals (and even some of those requirements are suspect: a lot of this
// data sheet was clearly copied-and-pasted from the data sheets for
// earlier Toshiba linear image sensors, and I suspect that some of the
// information is simply out of date, never properly revised for the design
// changes from the chip's predecessors.)
//
// We generate all three signals (FM, SH, and ICG) from PIO programs, one
// PIO program per signal.  The timing of the signals is coordinated in
// the DMA C IRQ handler.
//
// Since the FM, SH, and ICG signals are generated via PIOs, they're
// synchronized with the Pico's 125 MHz system clock.  The FM signal drives
// the sensor's shift register output, and we sample the shift register via
// the Pico ADC, so we must synchronize the ADC cycle with the FM signal.
// The Pico's ADC unfortunately doens't have an external trigger, so there's
// no way to feed the FM signal into the ADC to trigger the cycle directly.
// The closest thing the Pico ADC has to an external trigger is a clock
// trigger: we can program the ADC to run periodically on its master clock.
// So we can synchronize the ADC cycle and the FM cycle by tying them both
// to the same clock signal.  But there's another obstacle!  The ADC
// normally runs on the 48 MHz USB PLL clock, whereas the PIOs run on the
// 125 MHz system clock.  There's no way to reconfigure the PIOs to run on a
// different clock, but happily, the ADC can be moved to alternate clocks,
// including the system clock.  So the way to synchronize the FM and ADC
// cycles is to reprogram the ADC to run on the system clock, and then
// arrange the FM cycle so that two FM cycles exactly equal one ADC cycle in
// terms of system clocks.  With both units on the same clock, this is
// straightforward, because the ADC continuous-mode cycle is fixed at 96
// clock ticks.  This conveniently divides by 4 - convenient because the
// FM signal requires four phases (two square-wave cycles) per ADC cycle.

    // the current half of the double-buffer, and start writing into the
    // buffer we select as the read buffer, between the time we set up
    // our DMA and the time our DMA finishes.  But even if that happens,
    // we'll still have a stable result from the copy, thanks to the
    // TCD1103 structure.  Here's why.  Our DMA copy takes approximately
    // 5us (including setup time).  If the asynchronous writer happens
    // to switch buffers during that 5us, it will have a chance to do
    // 5us worth of writing into the same buffer that we're reading
    // from.  The ADC is programmed for 1.56us sampling cycles, so 5us
    // is enough time for the async writer to scribble over the first 3
    // samples in our buffer.  This is where the special structure of
    // the TCD1103 pixel array comes to the rescue: the first 16 pixel
    // array elements are "dummies" that aren't electrically connected
    // to live pixels.  They're meaningless samples that the client
    // ignores.  So those up-to-3 samples that might get scribbled over
    // in the worst-case race condition are going to be ignored anyway,
    // rendering the race harmless.  (And we have a considerable margin
    // of safety beyond this; with 16 dummy samples, we could tolerate
    // up to 24us of overlap in the transfers, which is a quite
    // leisurely interval on a 125MHz M0+.)
    //
    // This analysis depends upon the DMA transfer actually occuring in
    // 5us of real time, so we do have to turn off interrupts while
    // setting up the DMA transfer, to be sure that a random IRQ handler
    // from another subsystem can't steal any of our 5us during the DMA
    // setup.  Once the DMA is initiated, it's unaffected by interrupts,
    // so we only have to block interrupts long enough to figure out the
    // DMA source and pull the DMA trigger.
    //
    // One small caveat: The one bit of timing that isn't perfectly
    // deterministic here is the asynchronous DMA operation itself.  In
    // a vacuum, that time is predictable, but it's possible that some
    // other, higher-priority and bus-saturating DMA operation could be
    // taking place simultaneously, in which case our DMA transfer could
    // be locked out for an extended interval and thus take much longer
    // than 5us of real time to complete.  But if that were to happen,
    // this hypothetical other DMA transfer would also preempt the ADC
    // transfer for the same interval, making it late by the same amount
    // of real time.  So I think our original analysis still holds in
