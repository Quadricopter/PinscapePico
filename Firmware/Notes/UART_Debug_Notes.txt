To debug USB connection issues at startup, the best approach is to
attach the Pico to a host COM port via a UART adapter.  UART to USB
adapters are available from Amazon and other sources.  You'll need a
terminal program like PuTTY to connect to the virtual COM port.


SOFTWARE SETUP

In tusb_config.h, uncomment the following two lines to enable full
logging in the Tinyusb library:

//#define CFG_TUSB_DEBUG 2
//#define CFG_TUSB_DEBUG_PRINTF tusbLogPrintf


HARDWARE SETUP

Plug the UART-to-USB adapter into the PC.  The UART should have three
or four wires, usually color coded as:

TX = Green
RX = White
GND = Black
5V = Red (not present on all adapters, DO NOT CONNECT TO PICO if present)

Check your device's documentation to ensure it uses the standard color scheme.

Connect TX, RX, GND to the Pico as follows:

RX (White) -> pin 1 = GP0 
TX (Green) -> pin 2 = GP1
GND (Black) -> pin 3

Pin 1 is the pin at "northwest" (top left) if you hold the Pico with
the USB connector face up and facing north.
