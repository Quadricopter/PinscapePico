</div>

<h1>Boot Loader Mode</h1>
<p>
   This window lets you install firmware onto a Pico that's running in its
   native Boot Loader mode.
</p>
<p>
   The Boot Loader isn't part of Pinscape; it's a native feature built directly
   into the Pico.  You can get any Pico into Boot Loader mode at any time,
   regardless of any firmware you've previously installed on the Pico (Pinscape
   or otherwise), with this procedure:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Unplug the USB cable from the Pico (and any other power inputs)
   <li><b>Press and hold</b> the small white BOOTSEL button on top of the Pico
   <li>While still holding BOOTSEL, plug the USB cable back in
   <li>Release the BOOTSEL button
</ul>
<p>
   While in Boot Loader mode, the Pico appears on the Windows desktop as
   a generic USB thumb drive.  It's not <i>really</i> a thumb drive; it's
   just faking it as a convenient way to accept files for firmware installation.
   You can install firmware simply by copying a compiled firmware file,
   which on Windows has the suffix <b>.UF2</b>, onto the virtual thumb drive.
</p>
<p>
   Like most microcontrollers, the Pico can only run one firmware program
   at a time, so copying new firmware onto the Pico replaces any previously
   installed program.
</p>

<h2>Rebooting the Pico</h2>
<p>
   If the Pico already has the Pinscape (or other) firmware installed,
   you can get it back into the firmware program by power-cycling
   the Pico, by unplugging and re-plugging its USB cable.  Or, if you're
   using the Pico with an expansion board that features a RESET button,
   simply press the RESET button.
</p>
<p>
   If you install new firmware, the Pico will automatically reboot and
   run the new firmware when the installation file transfer finishes.
</p>

<h2>Installing firmware</h2>
<p>
   To install new firmware from this window, simply click the Install
   button.  This will bring up the usual Windows file selector dialog,
   where you can select the new firmware .UF2 file to install.
</p>

<h2>Erasing old config files</h2>
<p>
   This window lets you erase any Pinscape config files stored on the
   Pico.  This is meant as a last resort if you're having trouble getting
   the Pico to start up normally with the Pinscape software, and you suspect
   that something in the stored configuration is causing it to crash.
</p>
<p>
   To erase stored config data, select <b>Device &gt; Erase Flash Config Files</b>
   from the main menu.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Warning:</b> This command indiscriminately erases the portion of flash
   memory on the Pico where Pinscape stores its configuration data.  The
   command has no way to determine what's currently stored there, if
   anything, so it simply deletes the area unconditionally.  If the Pico
   in question is actually running some different firmware program instead
   of Pinscape, that other software might be using the same flash area for
   its own purposes.  This command can't tell the difference, so be careful
   to only use the command with a Pico that you know has Pinscape loaded.
</p>

<h2>Clear the entire flash memory chip</h2>
<p>
   If you want to completely erase the Pico's flash memory, select
   <b>Device &gt; Clear Entire Flash</b> from the main menu.
</p>
<p>
   This command erases the entire Pico flash memory space, removing any
   firmware program that was previously installed, along with any other
   data stored in flash.
</p>
<p>
   This command is meant as a last resort to fix a Pico that's not working
   properly.  There's no reason to use this command with a working Pico,
   and in particular, it's not necessary before installing a new firmware
   program.  Installing new firmware automatically overwrites any previous
   firmware.
</p>
<p>
   The main scenario where this command might be useful is if you're
   running firmware that stores its own additional information in flash
   storage, and something in its stored data has become corrupted in such
   a way that the program won't start up or run correctly, even after
   re-installing the firmware itself.  Re-installing firmware only overwrites
   the portion of flash that the program occupies, so it's possible for
   extra data areas to survive program updates.  indeed, Pinscape
   takes advantage of this to store the JSON configuration data, so that
   your configuration remains intact across firmware updates.
   But this also has a rare downside, which is that if something in the
   stored data makes the program crash, re-installing the program isn't
   enough to cure the problem, since the bad data is still there.
</p>
<p>
   The difference between <b>Clear Entire Flash</b> and <b>Erase Flash Config Files</b>
   is simply the scope of the erasure.  <b>Clear Entire Flash</b> erases
   every byte of the flash, so it's quite time-consuming.  It's the nuclear
   option that ensures that absolutely no old data remains anywhere in memory
   after the wipe.  <b>Erase Flash Config Files</b> surgically erases just one
   small control block where Pinscape keeps track of its files.  This makes
   <b>Erase Flash Config Files</b> quite fast.
