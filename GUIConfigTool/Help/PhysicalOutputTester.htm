<h1>Output Hardware Tester</h1>
<p>
   This window lets you test the physical output ports directly,
   bypassing all of the software layers used for the logical ports.
   This is useful for determining whether a problem with a device
   is coming from the hardware or somewhere in the software.
   If a port fails to work correctly in this mode, the problem
   must lie in either the physical hardware, or in the device-level
   Pinscape software or configuration setup.
</p>
<p>
   The separate <a href="LogicalOutputTester.htm">Logical Output Port Tester</a>
   window lets you view and test the software ports that DOF and other
   game programs on the PC access.  DOF can't access the hardware ports
   you see here directly; it goes through the logical ports.  Your JSON
   configuration determines how the logical ports relate to the physical
   device outputs.
</p>
<p>
   <b style="color: red;">Warning! Flipper Logic timers are disabled
   when this view is active.</b>  Exercise caution
   with devices that could overheat if activated for long intervals,
   since the normal protective timers can't intervene in this mode.
   When you activate a device port in this mode, it will remain
   activated until you manually turn it back off.
</p>
<p>
   This mode shows a list of all of the physical output devices,
   with a slider control for each port that's enabled as an output.
</p>

<h2>Devices and ports</h2>
<p>
   The window shows the Pico's own GPIO ports, plus all of the
   external peripheral chips that you've configured that can act
   as output devices.  This includes PWM controller chips (TLC5940,
   TLC59116, PCA9685), shift register chips (74HC595), and GPIO
   port extender chips (PCA9555).
</p>
<p>
   Each Pico GPIO pin and each peripheral chip output pin is shown
   with a slider control.  You can use the sliders to control the
   current output level on each port, to test its effect on any
   attached devices.  The sliders use the native PWM range for the
   chip.  Some PWM chips have 8-bit ranges (0-255), and some have
   12-bit ranges (0-4095).  Non-PWM chips that can only act as
   simple on/off switches still present as slider controls, but
   the range is just 0 to 1, corresponding to OFF and ON.
</p>
<p>
   All of the controls in this view are direct hardware controls.
   None of the logical output port modifiers apply, since this
   view bypasses all of that.  No time limiters are applied,
   nor are features like gamma correction or active high/low
   polarity inversions.
</p>
   

<h2>Disabled ports</h2>
<p>
   Some types of devices have bidirectional ports, meaning that the
   ports can be individually configured as inputs or outputs.  That
   includes the Pico's GPIO ports as well as ports on GPIO extender
   chips, such as PCA9555.  The window shows ports for all of the
   devices that are <i>capable</i> of being assigned as logical output
   ports, but ports that aren't <i>actually</i> used as outputs will
   be shown as disabled.
</p>
<p>
   Pico GPIO ports are only enabled in this view when they're assigned
   to logical output ports in the configuration.  This avoids
   accidentally interfering with GPIO ports that are used for other
   purposes, such as for logic signal connections to peripheral chips.
