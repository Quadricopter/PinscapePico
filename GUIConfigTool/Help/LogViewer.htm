<h1>Log Viewer</h1>
<p>
   This window displays the Pinscape Pico device's message log.  The device
   maintains an in-memory log of recent informational and error messages
   about the device's status.  You can retrieve and view the latest messages
   with this tool.
</p>
<p>
   On the device, the log text is stored only in memory, not in permanent flash
   storage, so it's only possible to access text since the last Pico reboot.
   In addition, the memory space reserved for log storage is limited in size,
   so only the most recent text is available.  Older messages are discarded as
   needed to make room for new messages.  You can configure the memory limit
   via the JSON config file, with the <tt>logging.bufSize</tt> parameter.
</p>
<p>
   When you open the log viewer window, it immediately retrieves all of
   the available saved text on the device, going back as far as the memory
   limit allows.  The window then continues to update automatically as new
   messages appear.
</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>
   The print options should be reasonably familiar if you've ever used any
   other Windows programs, except that the Header and Footer settings in the
   Page Setup options have some extra hidden features.
</p>
<p>
   First, the header and footer each let you set up three sections, for
   text that's aligned at the left, center, and right side of the page.
   Separate the sections with the vertical bar symbol, "|".
</p>
<pre>
    This part is at the left|This is centered|This is at the right
</pre>
<p>
   If there are only two parts, they're aligned left and right:
</p>
<pre>
   This part is at the left|This part is at the right
</pre>
<p>
   If you want to include a vertical bar character literally in the
   header/footer text printed on the page, type it twice: ||.
</p>
<p>
   Second, there are several substitution variables that you can use,
   written as <tt>$(<i>name</i>)</tt>.  The substitution variables
   are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><tt>$(pageNum)</tt> = current page number
   <li><tt>$(numPages)</tt> = total number of pages
   <li><tt>$(date)</tt> = the current date, with system default formatting
   <li><tt>$(time)</tt> = the current time of day, with system default formatting
   <li><tt>$(unitNum)</tt> = the Pinscape unit number
   <li><tt>$(unitName)</tt> = the Pinscape unit name
   <li><tt>$$</tt> = a literal dollar sign, <tt>$</tt>
</ul>
