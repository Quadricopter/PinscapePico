<h1>Logical Output Port Tester</h1>
<p>
   This window is designed to help set up a Pinscape Pico device's output
   controller ports, by letting you directly test the Pinscape ports without
   having any pinball simulation software involved.  This bypasses all of the
   layers of software that the games use, to help isolate any problems.
   If the port doesn't work in Visual Pinball or other games, but it does
   work here, you can tell that the problem lies in one of the game
   software layers.  If the port doesn't work here, the problem somewhere
   in the device setup, either in the physical wiring, the electronics,
   or in the Pinscape firmware.
</p>
<p>
   This window tests the "logical" output ports, which are the numbered
   ports that you set up in your JSON configuration file for use in DOF
   and other game software.  Your configuration defines the mapping of
   each logical port to a physical port, which represents the hardware
   location where the feedback device (light, solenoid, motor, etc) is
   wired into the Pico or one of its peripheral chips.  A physical port
   can be one of the Pico GPIO ports, or a port on one of the supported
   external chips: a PWM controller (TLC59116, TLC5940, PCA9685), a
   shift register chip (74HC5595), or a GPIO extender (PCA9555).
   The <a href="PhysicalOutputTester.htm">Device Port Tester</a>
   window provides a more direct view of the hardware ports that
   bypasses the whole DOF/logical port setup.
</p>

<p>
   This window shows the list of logical (DOF) ports in the left panel,
   and the list of configured physical devices in the right panel.  You
   can use the sliders in the left panel to adjust the PWM level on each
   logical port, and observe the effect on the physical device ports.
   This lets you play the role that a game program or DOF would normally
   play, sending commands to the DOF ports to control feedback effects,
   but without any external game software involved.  It also lets you see
   the inner workings of the ports in more detail than you can see through
   game programs.
</p>
<p>
   You can't control the physical device ports directly in this view,
   since they're under the control of the logical ports.
</p>
   

<h2>Logical Ports</h2>
<p>
   The logical ports in the left panel are the software ports
   that programs like DOF can access to create feedback effects.
   We call these "logical" ports because they're entirely software
   abstractions.  What they mean physically is up to you to define
   in the JSON configuration file.
</p>

<h3>Port</h3>
<p>
   Each logical port is numbered.  Programs like DOF that access
   the ports for feedback effects work in terms of the port number.
   The port numbers correspond to the order of the ports in your JSON
   configuration file, with the first entry labeled Port #1.
</p>

<h3>Device port</h3>
<p>
   This shows the physical device port that the logical port is
   assigned to.  Ports that aren't mapped to physical outputs are
   shown as <b>Virtual</b>.
</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>
   This column shows each port's attributes, as a series of icons:
</p>
<style type="text/css">
#attrTable {
    margin: 1ex 2em;
}
#attrTable td {
    padding: 1ex 0px;
}
#attrTable td:nth-child(1) {
    vertical-align: top;
    padding-right: 2em;
}
</style>

<table id="attrTable">
   <tr>
      <td><div class="attrIcon" style="background-position: 0px 0px;"></div></td>
      <td>
         Gamma correction is enabled for the port.  The nominal output level is
         adjusted when sent to the underlying physical device to make brightness
         changes to an attached LED look more "linear" to the human eye, so
         that, for example, brightness level 128 looks about half as bright to
         the eye as brightness level 255.  The eye perceives brightness
         logarithmically, so the electronic notion of "half power" doesn't
         translate directly to the perceptual notion of "half brightness".
         Gamma correction applies an adjustment to the electronic power level
         on the port to make the apparent brightness more linear to a human viewer.

         "Noisy" port.  This port is designated as being associated with a noisy
         device, which tells the Night Mode feature to disable the port when Night
         Mode is engaged.

         "Inverted" port (the icon is the symbol used in electronic schematics
         to represent a logic inverter).  The logical port's PWM level is reversed when
         sent to the underlying physical device.  When the logical port is set to the maximum
         PWM level 255, the underlying physical port is set to 0% duty cycle, which
         turns the port fully off.  When the logical port is at PWM level 0, the
         underlying port is turned fully on, at 100% duty cycle.  In general, PWM
         level X is inverted to PWM level 255-X when send to the physical device.
         <p>
            Note that this doesn't tell you anything about the <b>physical voltage</b>
            on the port.  This just says that the logical PWM level is inverted when
            sent to the port.  Some of the physical output controller chips use
            "active high" wiring, where the port outputs 3.3V or some other
            positive voltage when ON, whereas other chips use "active low" wiring,
            where the port is pulled to 0V when ON.  The high or low voltage when
            a port is ON is intrinsic feature of the particular chip, and it isn't
            affected one way or the other by the "Inverted" status of the logical port.

         Flipper Logic is enabled on the port.  This means that the port has
         time limitations for continuous ON activation, as specified in your
         JSON configuration file.  Pinscape Pico has a flexible range of options
         for port time limiters, with the ability to cut the power entirely to
         the port when the time limit expires, or just reduce it to a safer
         level, if PWM control is available for the port.

         Computed port: This port has a <a href="JSONConfigRef.htm#outputs.source"><tt>source</tt></a>,
         defined in the JSON configuration, which calculates the PWM level for the port based
         on the scripting formula defined in the JSON file.  A computed port
         ignores the DOF input level and instead uses the result of the <tt>source</tt>
         formula.  The formula take its input from sources like button states, accelerometer
         input, the plunger position, the current time, and various waveform
         generators.  Pinscape updates the formula result every few milliseconds,
         so the port always shows the "live" result based on the all of its inputs.
         <p>
            Computed ports are still shown as logical ports, and DOF and other
            programs can still send commands to the port.  But in most cases, a
            computed port ignores its DOF input, since the <tt>source</tt>
            formula takes precedence.  The reason that DOF input is still allowed
            is that the DOF input itself can be used as an input to a <tt>source</tt>
            formula, so it might still be useful for some ports.

<h3>Host Level</h3>
<p>
   The Host level box shows the current port PWM level setting as set by the
   PC (the "host").  When you're playing a pinball game that uses feedback
   effects through DOF, this is the level most recently commanded by DOF.
   When you're using the Output Tester window, DOF isn't involved, but you
   can manually adjust the desired host level with the slider control next
   to the level box.
</p>
<p>
   The Host level is basically the <b>input</b> to the logical port.  For
   a "Direct" port, this usually just passes through directly to the underlying
   physical device.  If you have Flipper Logic enabled, that will override
   the host setting when the configured maximum ON time expires.  Gamma correction
   likewise tweaks the numeric level to change it from a linear brightness
   level to a gamma-corrected power level.  And if the
   Inverted attribute is set on the port, the Host level will be reversed
   on the 0-255 scale (so level X becomes level 255-X) when sending the level
   to the underlying physical port.  Regardless of all of these adjustments,
   though, the Host level always records the last level <i>commanded</i>
   by the host, even if the various other settings change the actual output
   value before it reaches the physical port.
</p>

<h3>Calc Level</h3>
<p>
   This is the calculated port PWM level, after applying the <tt>source</tt>
   calculation for a computed port.  For Direct ports, this just follows
   the Host level.  For Computed ports, this reflects the live result of
   the <tt>source</tt> calculation.
</p>
<p>
   As with the Host level, the Calc level reflects the result of the
   <tt>source</tt> calculation only, before any of the standard adjustments
   are applied (the Inverted attribute, gamma correction, and Flipper
   Logic time limiters).
</p>

<h3>Out Level</h3>
<p>
   This is the final PWM output level that the logical port sends to its
   assigned physical device port, after applying Flipper Logic timers
   and the Inverted attribute.  (This doesn't take into account gamma
   correction, though, since that's handled later on, after rescaling
   the DOF 0-255 value to the physical device's native PWM resolution.
   This lets the gamma correction take advantage of the greater PWM
   step resolution that some devices use.  That can make a big
   difference at the low end of the brightness scale, where the gamma
   curve flattens out to subtle gradations between levels that can't
   be represented in only 8 bits.  You can see the numerical effect of
   gamma correction, if any, on the physical device port in the right
   panel, which shows the result in the device's native units.)
</p>
<p>
   The logical port value is always on a scale of 0 to 255, where 0
   is fully off and 255 is fully on, at 100% duty cycle.  Intermediate
   values represent linearly proportional duty cycles, so 127 is about
   50% duty cycle, or half brightness/half power.  "Duty cycle" refers
   the percentage of time that the physical output port is switched
   on.  PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is a technique for controlling
   brightness or power by rapidly switching the voltage on and off,
   hundreds or thousands of times per second (depending on the
   specific physical device used).
</p>

<h3>Level control slider</h3>
<p>
   Each port row is equipped with a slider control that lets you
   adjust the output level on the port, to test that the outputs are
   working as expected and to see the effect of different settings.
   The slider adjusts the <b>Host</b> level, which is the same level
   that DOF sets when it sends commands to Pinscape.  This lets you
   see the effect of all of the <tt>source</tt> formula calculations
   and attribute adjustments when applied to any given DOF level.
</p>
<p>
   Note that you can adjust the slider control with the mouse or with
   the keyboard.  Click on the slider to give it focus, which lets you
   control it with the keyboard:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The Up/Down arrows and Right/Left arrows change the level up
   and down one step at a time

   <li>Ctrl+Up, Ctrl+Down, Ctrl+Right, and Ctrl+Left change the level
   up and down by 10 steps at a time

   <li>Shift+Up, Shift+Down, Shift+Right, and Shift+Left change the
   level up and down by 25 steps at a time

   <li>Type a number from 0 to 255 to jump directly to a level; press
   return to end the entry

   <li>Tab and Shift+Tab navigate through the slider list
</ul>

<h2>Physical devices</h2>
<p>
   The right panel shows the physical output devices, including the
   Pico's GPIO ports (which can be programmed individually as output
   controller ports) and external peripheral chips that you've
   set up through the JSON configuration file.
</p>

<p>
   The panel shows the ports grouped by physical chip.  Each chip's
   ports are listed by number, with a box showing the current output
   level on the port:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>X</b> means that the port isn't programmed as an output
   port.  It's either being used as an input port, or isn't being
   used at all.  This only applies to "bidirectional" devices,
   meaning that the hardware allows the ports to be individually
   configured as inputs or outputs; this includes the Pico's GPIO
   ports, and ports on GPIO extender chips like PCA9555.  For
   chips that are purely output devices, like PWM controllers
   and output shift registers, there aren't any "X" ports because
   the ports simply can't have any other function.

   <li><b>ON</b> or <b>OFF</b> means that the port is a digital
   output port, rather than a PWM port.  A digital port is
   basically a switch that can only be turned on and off.  Pico
   GPIO ports can be programmed as either PWM or digital output
   ports, while most of the peripheral chips are one or the other.
   The ON/OFF notation is used for chips that can only be set up
   as digital outputs, such as shift register chips (74HC595)
   and GPIO extenders (PCA9555).

   <li><b>A number</b> means that that port is programmed as a
   PWM output.  This shows the current output level using the
   native PWM step range for the individual chip:
   <ul>
      <li>GPIO ports: 0 to 255
      <li>TLC59116: 0 to 255
      <li>TLC5940: 0 to 4095
      <li>PCA9865: 0 to 4095
   </ul>
</ul>

<p>
   Note that output port status is shown even for ports that
   aren't mapped to logical output ports.  The diagram includes
   ports that are configured as outputs for other purposes,
   such as sending logic/control signals to peripheral chips.
