# Disable -Wpsabi.  This is a warning about possible library ABI
# incompatibilities that's some std:: library calls trigger.  It's
# always spurious for our setup because we don't use any pre-built
# libraries (which is what could trigger the underlying problem that
# the compiler is trying to warn us about), but the compiler can't
# know that, so we just have to disable the warning entirely.
