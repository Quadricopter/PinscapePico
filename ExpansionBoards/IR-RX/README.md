# IR Receiver Satellite Board for Pinscape Pico

This is a small satellite board for the Pinscape Pico expansion
boards (both the DIY-friendly and "Pro" boards), which hosts the IR
Receiver sensor that allows Pinscape to receive signals from IR remote
controls. 

The IR sensor is deliberately separated from the main board so that it
can be positioned where it can receive line-of-sight IR transmissions
from remote controls.  The main Pinscape boards are probably going to
be hidden inside your pinball cabinet, so it doesn't make sense to
position the IR receiver directly on those boards.  Instead, you'll
probably want to place the IR receiver somewhere either outside the
cabinet, or in an opening in the cabinet where it has a view of the
exterior.  For example, you could place it behind a small hole drilled
in your speaker panel, or in the front wall of the cabinet body.

There are two versions of the board: a DIY-friendly version that uses
through-hole parts, and a version using surface-mount parts.  The
versions are functionally identical, and both versions work with the
Pinscape DIY-Friendly and "Pro" SMD expansion boards.  All of them use
the same connectors.
