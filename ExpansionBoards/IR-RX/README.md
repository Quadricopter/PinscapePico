# IR Receiver Satellite Board for Pinscape Pico

This is a small "satellite" board for the Pinscape Pico expansion
boards (both the DIY-friendly and "Pro" boards), which hosts the IR
Receiver sensor that allows Pinscape to receive signals from IR remote
controls. 

The IR sensor is deliberately separated from the main board so that it
can be positioned somewhere suitable where it can receive
line-of-sight IR transmissions from remote controls.  The main
Pinscape boards are probably going to be hidden inside your pinball
cabinet, so it doesn't make sense to position the IR receiver directly
on those boards - you probably want to position it somewhere outside
the cabinet where it'll be able to "see" IR remotes that you point at
it.  For example, you could place it behind a small hole drilled in
your speaker panel, or in the front wall of the cabinet body.
